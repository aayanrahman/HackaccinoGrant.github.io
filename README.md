# Bloxy: Hackaccino Project
Welcome to Bloxy, a 3D VR website created using the A-Frame web framework as part of the Hack Club's Hackaccino grant initiative. By completing this project, I earned a free frappuccino!

## Project Overview
Bloxy is a 3D virtual reality website inspired by the Minecraft demo available on the A-Frame website under Guides. Imagine Minecraft, but with realistic earth physics. This project showcases the capabilities of A-Frame for creating immersive 3D experiences using HTML and A-Frame components, enhanced with a physics engine for realistic interactions.

## Features
3D VR Environment: Explore a virtual world reminiscent of Minecraft.

Realistic Physics: Experience a Minecraft-like environment with realistic earth physics, powered by the A-Frame physics engine.

Simple Navigation: Move around the 3D space using standard VR controls or WASD keys.

Interactive Elements: Engage with various objects within the virtual environment, all behaving according to the laws of physics.

## Technologies Used
A-Frame: The primary framework for building the 3D VR environment.

A-Frame Physics System: Adds realistic physics to the virtual environment, allowing objects to interact in a believable manner.

HTML5: For structuring the content of the website.

## Usage
Navigating the VR Space: Use your mouse or VR headset controls to move around and explore the 3D scene.

Interacting with Objects: Click or use VR controls to interact with objects, observing realistic physics responses.

## Contributing
Contributions to improve the Bloxy website are welcome. If you have suggestions or would like to add features, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
